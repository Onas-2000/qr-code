PROCESS:
I read through the readme.md that that came with the challenge folder and alo went through the styleguide, then after taking a look at the expected result and from what is expected i pondered on how i am to go about it, then i started the project in earnest, after i became satisfied with what i did to some extent, i deployed the site using netlify.
BUILT WITH:
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Web browser
- Github
- Netlify
What I learned? I learned, majorly that a readme in a repository is not just there void of function but to give a descriptive information on what brought about the project, which in the long run helps when it comes to collaborating wuth other developers, by making their linkup easier and from the project itself i was able to get a better understanding of the importance of units and classification when writing codes, which was one of the problems i faced while building my project.
Continued Development: I will like to keep working on how to make my website responsive, which is one of the issues while coming up with my project.
